 Changed February 10th Changed March 3rd Changed March 24th Unchanged April 1st  Unchanged April 15th  ← → Posted on February 1, 2017 by sally  by sally  blais.patrice@gmail.com ← →   The minor modifications of this new protocol were agreed to by CUPFA following discussions that would accommodate the Employer, while keeping the dates at the end of the process intact.  The Employer’s position was that the timing of the initiation of the hiring process was difficult to incorporate into their deadlines.  This new process will now give the same amount of time as that allocated for the other hiring processes in the May and October periods. The dates will be modified as follows: Posting deadlines: Changed from February 1st to February 10th Application deadlines: Changed from February 15th to March 3rd Recommendation deadlines: Changed March 15th ie. March 24th Contract printing deadline: Unchanged April 1st  Contract signing deadline: Unchanged April 15th  Please note  that the final contract signing deadline remains unchanged. » Download Appendix H 2017 – pdf
