materials that require special handling and preservation because of their rarity, fragility, unusual format, or uniqueness. Special Collections supports the research needs of the Concordia University community by providing its members with access to
vibrant primary and secondary source materials. The majority of our collections do not circulate and are housed at the Vanier Library on Concordia's Loyola Campus. Some
specialized materials are integrated with the Libraries circulating collection and may be found at both the Webster and Vanier Libraries. Archives & Special Collections Shared Catalogue  Collection development policy
