Concordia University, with the aim of providing emerging artists with practical skills, tools, and
knowledge. Art Matters takes place in March. Exhibitions curated by students are spread out over three
weeks, punctuated by our signature parties and events. Art Matters is a fee-levy organization. That means a fraction of all students' tuition allows the
festival to take place. Art Matters is created by and for undergraduate Concordia University
students. Art Matters gets people together. We encourage students from different artistic practices to
exchange ideas. Art Matters supports new ideas. We promote diverse artistic approaches, processes, and
risk-taking. Art Matters starts a dialogue between students and professionals. We provide galleries and
venues as platforms to promote artwork, as well as hosting speakers and workshops. Art Matters strives to build an inclusive community. Art Matters encourages accessibility and
diversity. Art Matters makes it known that Art Matters! If you'd like to get in touch face-to-face, please contact us at info@artmattersfestival.org www.facebook.com/artmattersfestival Art Matters is a fee-levy organization. In order to opt out, please arrange a drop-in at our office

spaces. In November, artists submit artworks or in-progress proposals to the festival. All artistic
practices are welcomed, all undergraduate students may apply. Art Matters offers several honorarium-based jobs to undergrads. Positions in photography,
videography, translation, copy editing, technical direction, volunteer coordination and more are
made available year-round. Check our Facebook  page for more info. New faces are always welcomed to volunteer at exhibitions and events! The call-out for
volunteers occurs early in the Winter semester. 
Our board determines how the festival operates, directs its goals and initiatives, ensures that it
runs smoothly, and joins in the fun of planning events. To learn more or express interest in
joining, come to our first General Meeting in October.
