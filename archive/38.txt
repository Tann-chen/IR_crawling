Our graduating students have created works in  all of the print disciplines including Lithography, Intaglio, Woodcut,  Screenprint, Book Arts, Digital Print, and several have integrated these  into Installation and Performance art.While the students who  submitted works for consideration by the jury must have completed at  least two advanced courses in the Print Media Program, they did not have  to be Print Media majors or minors. Several students are majoring in  other programs within the Studio Arts Department. Considering their rich  content and sophisticated conceptual focus, along with their technical  excellence, the works represent a view into cutting edge contemporary  print practices. We welcome you and will enjoy seeing you at the  vernissage!Judy GarfinImage (c) Sarah Long h, 6 - 9 pm  Gallery Hours: March 21st - 24th, 12 - 7 pm

 Welcome to the recently and shoddily updated SPA website! For those of you unsure of what we in SPA do, feel free to read our constitution. For those of you who already know what SPA is, feel free to ignore it! Please email us if you have any questions or if you would like to be added to our mailing list. Thanks and have a good rest of the semester!

The SPA collective has existed since 1998 and has since been largely responsible for many of the print program’s extracurricular undertakings.             The association aims to provide an environment for artistic exchange and to build a stronger community within the program. Our intentions are to compliment the regular curriculum with activities that are not usually available within the department. These activities allow students to further their knowledge and to expand their horizons. The projects we intend on undertaking include: workshops, exhibitions, inter-university exchanges, a more informative website, newsletters, artist talks, and more. In the past years, SPA has been responsible for organizing inter-city print exchanges, multiple book projects, several diverse exhibitions, vernissages, and annual print sales, Concordia based or inter-university print exchange and more. SPA works as an open club, in which every registered print student is automatically a member. Positions work on a volunteer basis and students can choose their own level of involvement. To ensure a system of organization, SPA consists of an executive committee formed in the fall of each year.
