TD 21 (2nd Floor)    Who we are: Students of History at Concordia (SHAC), founded in 1978, is an organization created to protect and advance the interests of Concordia history students. We represent all Concordia undergraduates registered in a history class. We are committed to organizing events that bring students and faculty together outside the classroom. In addition, we have been hard at work publishing Historiae, a scholarly journal bringing together the best undergraduate history essays, since 2001 . SHAC is a growing organization with numerous volunteer positions and ways to involve yourself in student life. We are genuinely committed to transparency and inclusion. Come to our events, review our minutes and participate in our General Assemblies! SHAC is entirely funded by YOU, so be sure to get involved with how we spend your money.   Contact Us: Office: TD 21 (second floor and second door to the left) Phone: (514) 848-2862 Email: SHAC@asfa.ca
