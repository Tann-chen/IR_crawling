Commission and Artist Fees:  up to $8,000 CAD The deadline for this call for proposal has been extended to November 24, 2017 at 11:59 pm. The Concordia Library is seeking to commission a content creator or team to
	create an engaging custom public audio-visual art piece to celebrate the launch
	of the Visualization Studio and the completion of the Webster Library renovation.
	The visualization will be displayed on the touch-interactive wall of the
	Visualization Studio, on the third floor of the Webster Library, and will be
	visible to all visitors. It will be one of the main visualizations showcasing
	the new space. The Concordia Library welcomes artists, creatives, scientists, engineers,
		interdisciplinary scholars to apply and encourages bold, creative and playful projects.
Applications will be open until November 24, 2017, at 11:59 pm, and can be submitted by email.
 Selected works must be operational by March 2017. Installation: March 2018 The Visualization Studio is a visualization environment; an innovative,
	collaborative and interdisciplinary creative facility for research, teaching
	and learning, situated in the Webster Library.
 The Visualization Studio supports new and experimental modes of research,
	emerging technologies and interdisciplinary collaborative work; and offers
	immersive visualizations and visualization analytics.
 The studio will open its doors in February 2018. To celebrate the Library’s recent renovation, the Concordia Library is looking
	for creative members of the Concordia community -- designers, scientists, engineers,
	creatives, artist groups, etc. -- to create an audiovisual or visual piece to
	display on the Visualization Studio’s interactive wall. The commission piece will
	mark the launch of the Visualization Studio and will be used to showcase the potential
	of the studio and its interactive wall. The selected work will also be presented to a
	passing audience. Artwork on the Visualization Studio’s interactive wall can function as a form
	of communication to an audience in transit through the Library, with the goal
	of creating a vibrant and interesting environment. Successful content submissions must be innovative in design and engaging.
Submissions that are interactive, playful and immersive are encouraged.
 Selected submissions will be used to showcase the space as one of the main
	demo pieces in the Visualization Studio, and will be displayed on the interactive
	wall outside of work hours and when the studio is not in use. This means that submissions must be first and foremost functional as standalones
	without any technical supervision, and must run from the graphical workstation,
	which is the main computer in the Visualization Studio. Pieces can be augmented
	with VR, interactivity and sensors, but must remain functional as a plug-and-play
	function so they can be put on display and occupy the whole wall when the studio is locked.
 Applicants whose work is selected will be asked to showcase a prototype in January 2018.
	The final piece must be operational by March 2018. The Visualization Studio is 36 ft wide and 25 ft long. There is a 23 ft wide window opposite the interactive wall, which interfaces with the hallway.   
The interactive wall display will remain turned on outside of opening hours and will act as a digital space for public exhibits, public art, etc.
  The selected applicant or team will receive funding of up to $8,000 CAD to produce their proposed work.   Applicants must be affiliated with Concordia (Faculty, students, staff) or partnered with Concordia members. This invitation is open to creative applicants from all backgrounds and disciplines.
