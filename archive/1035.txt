Workshops, conferences and social networking events are only a few opportunities we offer to students in order to bridge the gap between being a student and having a career in marketing. It is our mission to give marketing students the most fulfilling university career and a non-literal toolbag to prepare them for their professional lives ahead. This year we are a team of 13 dedicated individuals with a passion for marketing and weâre dizzy with excitement for the year ahead.
