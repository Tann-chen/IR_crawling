Concordia University is one of Canada's most dynamic universities in one of North America's most livable cities. It reflects a unique blend of commitments to diversity, accessibility, social responsibility, and innovation. With over 46,000 students (6,300 international) and nearly 1,700 full-time and part-time professors, Concordia is recognized for offering a rich academic experience combined with strong community engagement.   This is a time of change for Concordia University Library. A new library space was recently inaugurated in the Grey Nuns Building. A major renovation and expansion project is transforming the Webster Library at the Sir George Williams Campus (downtown), and will be complete in the fall of 2017. An innovative technology program is being developed and will contribute to enhance the students experience in the libraries. Concordia Library recently developed a strategic plan for  2016-2021. Some of the highlights from the plan's goals and objectives include: In light of this, the Concordia Library Researcher-in-Residence program was created to promote research in the library and the use of research by practitioners. The program offers the opportunity for scholars, information professionals, or doctoral students to focus on an area of inquiry in a supportive and enriching environment, and to interact with Concordia Library staff and its resources. The presence of the Researcher-in-Residence in Concordia Library has as one of its goals to foster a culture of research. It is hoped that throughout the residency, both the researcher and staff will become engaged in the use of research in library practice and the concept of evidence-based librarianship. The residency period is from January 1 to December 1, 2018. Proposals which include alternative start dates and those of different duration will also be considered. The inaugural Researcher-in-Residence began in January 2017. More information can be found on the Concordia website.
