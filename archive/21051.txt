"Vimeo PRO has been crucial for our success. Every day, we use private review pages and password protection to review and prepare work. When we're ready to go live, we instantly benefit from the built-in support of the vibrant Vimeo community." Justin Cone, Motionographer "All my filmmaker friends were on Vimeo, so I decided I should probably do the same. The interface is clean, and the profiles are like a second website — it’s a great way to promote your work and keep in touch with other filmmakers." Ace Norton, Director "Vimeo is a vital part of my filmmaking process. I use it to privately store videos throughout production — anything from location scouts, to test scenes, rehearsals, or different cuts of the film that I can easily share with my team." Kate Herron, Writer / Director "I use Vimeo PRO to host my educational video content. My PRO account gives me clean control of the look and feel of my videos. We also use Vimeo PRO to preview and review all of our edits and make notes within our team, sharing the content before it goes live to the public." Shane Hurlbut, ASC "Vimeo has always attracted creative professionals. The content you tend to 'discover' on the platform reflects that community. It's always high quality, well made, and original."
