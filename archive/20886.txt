                                                             - Marcia Howard, Production Manager at TheMuse.com

Every day, we use private review pages and password protection to review and prepare work. When we’re ready to go live, we instantly benefit from the built-in support of the vibrant Vimeo community."
                                                             - Justin Cone, Motionographer

It’s absolutely my go-to as far as uploading any video content to the Internet."
                                                             - Allie Avital, Filmmaker/Director A free Basic membership is pretty great, but if you want priority support, tons more storage, advanced privacy control, player customization, or interaction tools (like cards and calls to action in the embedded player), Vimeo Plus, PRO, and Business are for you. And unlike YouTube, we never put ads before, during, or after your videos. Yes! We really do! All our members get unlimited bandwidth in the Vimeo player, included in the cost of their monthly or annual membership. While other vendors charge extra for bandwidth or plays, we’re all about your videos being as successful as possible — and we don’t penalize you for it. For those on a tight budget, this is especially good news: you’ll never encounter surprise charges for overages, so long as you’re using our gorgeous player. Nope. Vimeo Basic is perfect for individuals who want to join our amazing community, but who might not be uploading tons of HD videos each week. If that sounds like you, you might never pay a dime for Vimeo. Creators and businesses often upgrade to Vimeo Plus, PRO, or Business because they find they want to store more videos, get advanced player customization and privacy options, access powerful marketing and analytics tools, and more. You have up to 30 days to get a full refund for an annual membership. If you no longer need the added benefits of Plus, PRO, or Business, you can downgrade back to Basic. Absolutely not. Your work will never be tarnished by in-video ads. That’s right — no pre-roll, post-roll, or overlays. On Vimeo, you can present your work in exactly the way you want. Should you hit your storage limit, you can upgrade to Vimeo Plus, PRO, PRO Unlimited, or Business. Members of these plans get tons more storage, in addition to advanced customization and powerful marketing and analytics tools, than Vimeo Basic members. No way! Unlike other video-hosting platforms, there are no file-size or duration limits up to your weekly or total storage limit. Yes, but you’ll need to upgrade to Vimeo PRO or Business. You can try an annual plan risk-free for 30 days, and a monthly plan for 5 days. If you’re not satisfied with your membership, you can get a refund within the appropriate trial period as long as you’ve streamed for no more than 15 minutes total and you haven’t violated our Terms of Service. Yes! All the features of Vimeo PRO are included in PRO Live, and all the features of Vimeo Business are included in Business Live. If a Business member opts for a PRO Live plan, however, they will get Vimeo PRO features without retaining their Business ones. For this reason, we recommend current Business members choose a Business Live plan. You can use any hardware or software encoder that you choose, as long as RTMP streaming is enabled. We recommend Livestream Studio, Mevo, OBS, Telestream Wirecast, Teradek VidiU, NewTek TriCaster or Epiphan Pearl, but feel free to use whichever encoder works best for you. Streaming hours refer to the total number of hours you can stream your live events, which varies by membership. While each individual event can be a maximum of 5 hours for all Vimeo Live plans, Business Live members get unlimited streaming hours per month. Nope. You can stream to as many viewers as you want without worrying about overages. Your audience will be able to see your events in 1080p, as long as your source stream is outputting at 1080p and your audience has a strong network connection. If not, they’ll be served a stream at the quality appropriate to their device and bandwidth. Cloud transcoding means that all live streams are transcoded by Vimeo for optimal playback in the Vimeo player. This provides viewers with the most beautiful experience possible for their device and bandwidth, keeps your required outbound bandwidth to a minimum, and saves you the trouble of using expensive encoding equipment.
