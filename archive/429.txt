Concordia digs into Montrealâs messy roads. Concordia faculty and staff are ready to provide expert opinion, comment and analysis on current news. The latest research findings and releases coming out of Concordia. Harold Chorney, professor in the Department of Political Science in the Faculty of Arts and Science, writes in The Conversation Canada about the election of ValÃ©rie Plante to the mayor's office. He reflects on the groundbreaking nature of the Plante victory: a relative unknown who defeated a career politician to become Montreal's first female mayor. He looks also at the major challenge facing Plante from Day One: the city's crumbling infrastructure and Plante's campaign promises to make things right on our traffic-jammed roads, notably by making public transit a solid and welcoming alternative to the car.  Thien Thanh Dang-Vu, MD, and Associate Professor at Concordia University, researches sleep at the PERFORM Centre Sleep lab. By studying the brain waves produced during sleep alongside patientâs responses to cognitive behavioral therapy, Dang-Vu has identified a pattern that helps identify those who are more receptive to this type of treatment. Following the publication of the preliminary findings of this research, Dang-Vu has worked with the media promoting both the results, and the Sleep Centerâs ongoing need for study participants. This has resulted in extensive coverage in Le Devoir, and several segments on Radio Canadaâs PremiÃ¨re ChaÃ®ne network, broadcast across the country and throughout Quebec.    The NOW newsletter is Concordia's official source of news and events. © Concordia University
