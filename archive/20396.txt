   vidéos Corner Conversations (« conversations du coin ») montrent des conversations avec des étudiantes aux cycles supérieurs en éducation artistique qui ont eu lieu à la Galerie FOFA. Ces échanges s’articulent autour de travaux de recherche en cours et ont pour but de susciter des discussions et de mieux faire connaître les questions d’actualité en art contemporain. Le titre Corner conversations a été choisi pour évoquer une diffusion des idées abordées dans tous les recoins de la société et de la conscience collective.The Corner Conversations videos capture conversations that took place at the FOFA gallery with graduate students in Art Education. The conversations highlight ongoing research in order to generate discussion and awareness about current issues in contemporary art. The idea of the “corner” conversation becomes a metaphor for these ideas reaching all corners of society and public consciousness.FOFA Gallery, Concordia UniversityBy: Katie Lefevre, Art Education Research Assistant Featuring: Anna Timm-Bottos, Bettina Forget, Emma Harake, and Lucie Lederhendler2016-2017
