If you are reading this, then your browser is not supporting our video :( The John Molson Marketing Association is a versatile team of motivated and wildly imaginative students who strive to enlighten the minds of our fellow classmates by encouraging them to explore, create and stay curious. Workshops, conferences and social networking events are only a few opportunities we offer to students in order to bridge the gap between being a student and having a career in marketing. It is our mission to give marketing students the most fulfilling university career and a non-literal toolbag to prepare them for their professional lives ahead. This year we are a team of 13 dedicated individuals with a passion for marketing and weâre dizzy with excitement for the year ahead. Get in touch with us in a moment.
