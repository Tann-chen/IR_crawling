 Mature content filter:  A practical and ethical guide to using Vimeo (and attaining enlightenment). The Internet is a pretty cool place, but it also gives people the means to insult and/or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We request — nay, we insist! — that while you are on Vimeo you respect the people you encounter, as well as their videos. You are free to disagree and/or provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. 
                        The best way to encourage others to watch your videos is to participate in the community — join groups, follow other members and channels related to your interests, and leave thoughtful comments on other members’ videos. Don’t send unsolicited mass messages or post promotional comments. Don’t pay for views and likes. And please don’t flood Vimeo with videos uploaded by a robot or a robot-like human in a manner that will disrupt people’s experience here.
                     Vimeo is an amazing place to connect with other people who make and love awesome videos. Don’t abuse those connections with comments or messages that make the recipient feel uncomfortable, such as sexualized compliments or unwelcome advances. Make sure your user avatar and profile do not include nudity, explicit or gory images, spammy links, or details designed to impersonate any other person or business. 
                        If you’re uploading commercial or business content, make sure you read our Commercial Content Guidelines as well. Thanks!                     Commercial content includes: If the videos you’re uploading fit any of these descriptions, you must use Vimeo PRO or Vimeo Business. Exception! If you’re an independent production company, artist, or non-profit, you may use any account type to showcase your creative work. Read more. 
Private Mode: PRO and Business members can use Private Mode to hide their videos and profile from discovery on vimeo.com or through search engines. Learn more about hosting and sharing private videos.                     Businesses can share their videos on Vimeo, but cannot use comments, private messages, or the Vimeo Forum for promotional purposes. Vimeo was founded in 2004 by people who wanted to share creative work and personal moments from their lives. As time went on, other likeminded individuals discovered Vimeo and helped build a supportive community covering a wide range of interests. In other words, Vimeo is a community of real, amazing humans, and the Vimeo Guidelines help us keep that magical humanity alive. We hope this environment inspires you to create and contribute in positive ways. About Vimeo Find out what makes us tick. Help Center Ask questions, read our FAQ, and browse the forums.
