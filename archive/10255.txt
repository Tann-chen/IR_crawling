The Award for the Best Feature Film (in competition) at #SAFFM2017 went to A Walnut Tree by Ammar Aziz.  Alan Wong on our jury said "I was captivated by the poetic tone of A Walnut Tree; it drew me into the narrative with its beautiful words and images that gradually exposed the harsh and tragic circumstances experienced by the film's subjects. The filmmaker has presented a side of the refugee crisis that I had never heard about, but in such a mesmerizing way that I most certainly shall not soon forget.” "Transgender issues have been all over the news over the past couple of years. Whether it is have accessible bathroom facilities, their serving in the American military, transgender celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox or films (The Danish Girl, Dallas Buyers Club, The Skin I Live In) or television shows (Orange is the New Black, Transparent, I Am Jazz) featuring transgender characters. A light is being shone and a voice is being acknowledged. Still we have much to learn about and from. Documentaries like Transindia by Meera Darji go a long way towards education and demystification."    The award for Best Short Film (in competition) went to The School Bag by Dheeraj Jindal, a jury member described it as "“very touching and beautifully directed film that conveys its message sensitively and without melodrama".

The defining characteristics of SAFFM – the lesser-known films, the opportunity for discussion, and the chance to hear censored and marginalized voices – culminate to create an intimate and extremely satisfying experience for the viewer. Avoid the rain and take advantage of this amazing opportunity, you will not regret it.""
