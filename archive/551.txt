                 2067 is a TOL podcast mini-series about the future, seen through the lens of emerging research interests at Concordia University. Hosted by Francine Pelletier.  Download Yeast is the answer? Research Malcolm Whiteway speaks with Clea Desjardins about how his work with yeast can help develop a new generation of drugs with fewer side effects - particularly for those with compromised immune systems. Healing faster with yeast? With host Francine Pelletier.

Researcher Steve Shih, an engineer with a background in biology, and graduate student Hugo Sinha, speak to Clea Desjardins about connecting engineering and the science around cancer research.  With host Francine Pelletier. 
 Read more about Steve Shih Read more about microfluidics Download The heart is at once of the most personal of organs, and yet it is transferrable. Every year, about 5,000 people worldwide receive someone elseâs heart. What does it mean to have another personâs heartbeat keeping you alive? Will heart transplants be even more common in the future?  In this episode, artist Ingrid Bachmann speaks with Clea Desjardins about the art of the heart transplant. With host Francine Pelletier.
 Read more about Ingrid Bachmann Read more about Hybrid Bodies Download The heart - a giant pump, the most machine-like and yet the most human of organs.  Every minute, it pumps about five litres of blood through a system of blood vessels nearly 100,000 kilometres long - that's about 7,500 litres of blood every day. But could a mechanical device do the job just as well? In this episode, Lyes Kadem speaks with Clea Desjardins about what it means to engineer mechanical hearts - and what might replace the pacemaker of the future.  With host Francine Pelletier.   Read more about Lyes Kadem Download Kimberley Manning studies social movements, policy reform and gender politics, drawing on research in rural Chinese villages and county archives. Among her findings is the critical role of family networks of support â of what she calls filial ties â to political life. But there is more to the story of family ties â¦ In this episode, she speaks with Francine Pelletier about the complexity and importance of filial ties and the unexpected connection she found between transgender politics and Chinese political history.  Read more about Kimberley Manning Download We can't save everything - biologist Dylan Fraser speaks to Clea Desjardins about why and how eco-evo-gen (an combination of ecology, evolution and genetics) helps us rationalize where to focus conservation, for more effective conservation and management of natural populations and species. Is this a new Noah's Ark? With host Francine Pelletier.

Read more about Claudine Gauthier Download Climate researcher Damon Matthews tracks the rise in greenhouse gases, measuring the impact of global warming and trying to get people to listen to hard science. The time for debate has passed, now we have to figure out how we can avoid the nightmare scenarios presented in Hollywood movies by changing our habits. Matthews believes our future, in 2067 and beyond, depends on taking actionâ¦ now. With host Francine Pelletier. Read more about Damon Matthews Download Menâs studies, the study of what it means to be a man, is informed by a variety of academic areas and disciplines, including feminist theory. Itâs a relatively new area of research that understands masculinity as multiple and varied. In this episode, Marc Lafrance walks us through the future of brawn and the presumed crisis of masculinity in the contemporary age. Read more about Marc Lafrance Download Think about your voting experiences â about receiving your notification in the mail, about ensuring time to get to the voting location, about lining up, about ensuring you are on the list.  And then, thereâs the voting booth â paper and pencil, special folds of the ballot, boxes, hand-countsâ¦. Where is the technology? In this episode, host Francine Pelletier and researcher Jeremy Clark explore issues around technology and voting. Read more about Jeremy Clark Download What do robots, space exploration, the environmental movement and the survival of the human race have in common? In this episode, Krzysztof Skonieczny talks about links between life on the Red Planet and space robotics. Are robots paving the way to vacations on Mars? Will we be able to live there by 2067, and will we have to reinvent the wheel to do so? Read more about Krzysztof Skonieczny Download Consider fitness and activity tracking devices (like the popular fitbit), or apps on your phone that help monitor weight, eating habits, exercise, heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels â even your sleep can be monitored. In this episode, Francine Pelletier speaks to researchers at Concordia University about the ways body feedback is communicated â and how it can improve our health. The future is about health literacy through self-monitoring. Youâre bodyâs calling, are you listening?
 Read more about Joanna Berzowska    Download Look back at images of what we thought the future might be â you know, images from the 1950s and 60s with people getting around via jetpacks. Futurism has always had a fascination with tranport. In this episode,  Zachary Patterson talks about how we currently get from Point A to Point B, and how our modes of transportation might change in the future. Will we all be flying around with jetpacks strapped to our backs in 2067? Or is the future of transit on two wheels? Read more about Zachary Patterson How do we imagine our future? In the 1950s and 60s there was a creative imagining of technology and the future, most of it utopian. Think images of flying cars, cities under glass, helpful cyborgs, aluminum clothing, and personal jetpacks. Some of these ideas about the future were not so far off â but what inspires our future thinking now? Can we use university research to imagine new possibilities? Can we speculate along with researchers about whatâs next? Whatâs in your future? This is 2067. Concordia is pleased to have Francine Pelletier hosting the 2067 mini-series on research and the future. Francine Pelletier has been a journalist and political commentator for over 30 years, working in both French and English, and contributing to both electronic and traditional print media. She is a co-founder of the magazine La Vie en rose (1980-87), and has written for La Presse (1988-92), numerous magazines including L'ActualitÃ©, Macleans, ChÃ¢telaine, and contributedto television productions such as Sunday Edition (CTV) and The Editors (PBS).   She has been a political correspondent with Radio-Canada and CBC Radio, and was contributor and co-host of CBC's the fifth estate (1995-2000). Today she juggles a busy  schedule of teaching at Concordia's Journalism Department, writing a weekly column for Le Devoir newspaper and directing documentary films.   The TOL podcasts are produced by a team at Concordia university interested in connecting university research and big ideas to public interest.   Francine Pelletier (Host) Johanne Pelletier (Executive Producer) Marie-Christine Houle (Producer) Clea Desjardins (Producer/interviewer) Fiona Downey (Producer)
