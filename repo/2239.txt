 Tillutarniit Film Festival, FOFA GalleryAugust 3, 4, 5, 2017Outdoor Film Festival Celebrating Inuit CultureCurated by: Isabella-Rose WeetaluktukVideo: Victor ArroyoMore information (et pour la version française) :   is an annual outdoor film festival curated by Isabella-Rose Weetaluktuk, an emerging Inuk curator, filmmaker and artist. The event celebrates Inuit culture with games, prizes, country food, music and film. This year’s program was framed around the animals that are intrinsic to life in the north grouped into three themes for each evening: Netsiq (Seal), Tuktu (Caribou) and Inuk (Person). The seal and the caribou are central to Inuit mythology, storytelling, hunting, clothing, food, art and design. Films highlighted the importance of these animals in relation to the Inuk while drawing attention to current challenges that threaten the Inuit way of life. Stunning cinematography, enthralling narratives reveal so much about the majestic land, animals and people who define the north.The event coincided with Présence Autochtone Montreal First Peoples Festival, and was in partnership with Terres en vues / Land Insights.This initiative was made possible by the Community Fund for Canada’s 150th, a collaboration between Canada’s community foundations, Foundation of Greater Montréal, the Government of Canada, and extraordinary leaders from coast to coast to coast.
