 For architect, painter and photographer Charles C. Gurd, fine arts study is about learning to apply creativity to problem-solving. It’s a skill he sees as vital to society.That’s why Gurd helps encourage tomorrow’s creative minds as a mentor and as a donor. His support to students at Concordia University, in Montreal, allows them to apply for the Charles C. Gurd Artist Residency Award at the Vermont Studio Center. Through a planned gift at Concordia, Gurd has ensured the cultivation of artistic talent beyond his lifetime. Planned gifts, often called legacy giving or living bequests, can support undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, faculty chairs, research, infrastructure and more. A planned gift can enable you to make a more significant contribution than you thought possible, while allowing you to achieve financial and tax benefits that help fulfill your philanthropic and estate-planning goals. At Concordia, we have a myriad of planned giving options from which you can choose. Planned Giving  Concordia’s Advancement and Alumni Relations
