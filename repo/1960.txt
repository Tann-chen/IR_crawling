 The name, more beautiful than a flowerDance performance commissioned by Seonjeong YiFeaturing the Blackswan Dance Company: Kyungchan Song, Bunseon Kim, and Kibum ParkJune 7, 2017, FOFA Gallery CourtyardThis performance is based on stories about Japanese Military “Comfort Women” who were used as sex slaves during the Pacific War. Histories of these women are largely omitted from cultural institutions and public media, spurring curator Seonjeong Yi to develop an art and educational program centered on victims’ trauma and experiences.Documented by Steven Smith Simard, FOFA Gallery
