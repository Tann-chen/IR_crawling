Open Positions
 Vimeo is a video-sharing community for original creative work and the people who create it. What started with a few filmmaker friends in 2004 now reaches 90+ million people around the world every month. It’s our mission to help people share what they make, whether they’re grizzled old pros or have never heard of a camera before. We do it by nurturing the most vibrant, constructive, respectful community around. But don’t take our word for it: “Vimeo is the handsomest company in the world.” We’re a bunch of buds who get together each day to make something we all use and love; it just so happens that thing is a fast-growing company and one of the largest video communities in the world. Many of us started as Vimeo users before we got jobs here (Mark Wahlberg would play us in a movie). When we all pile into a big room to watch the month’s Staff Picks, it’s easy to remember why we do this.
