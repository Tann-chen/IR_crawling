   CUPFA News is one of the communication vehicles to inform the membership about issues and events.  It is important for members to read CUPFA News along with emails and all correspondence sent by the Association rather than feign ignorance after the fact.  CUPFA News is issued once a year at the end of November, or start of December and is mailed to members.  It is also available on the CUPFA website.  In addition to CUPFA News, another communication vehicle, Nego News, is a specialised newsletter to apprise the membership about the progress of contract negotiations when the Association is at the bargaining table.
