To obtain a Library Privilege Card, the user must bring the documents required for their user group to the Circulation Desk at either the Vanier Library or the Webster Library during service hours.  Research and reference assistance is offered on a priority basis to Concordia's primary constituency, that is, currently enrolled Concordia University students, faculty and staff. Reference assistance is provided to other users as time permits. All persons using the library must respect the Library Code of Conduct. * Driverâ€™s license with an address or photo ID with some proof of residence (e.g., utility bill). Thanks for your time.
