For assistance, go to Concordia IT Services' page on netname account management. Concordia's Virtual Private Network (VPN) is an alternative to authenticating with a netname or Library PIN. This allows you to access resources that may otherwise only be accessible in the library. Nonetheless, some databases still require netname or Library PIN authentication as do library services such as My Library Account, Article Delivery, and COLOMBO (Interlibrary Loans). NOTE: Concordia IT Services is responsible for the VPN. For help, contact the IT Service Desk. You may alternatively log in with the Library Barcode and PIN option. This is the only method for non-Concordia users to access their record. Enter: If you are a student, you must be registered in a credit-bearing course in order to access our resources from off-campus.

Problems may include: If this is the case, contact the Circulation Desk at Webster Library or Vanier Library. Try using a different browser. For example, if you are having trouble accessing a database while using Internet Explorer, try using Firefox instead. If you are using Internet Explorer, try resetting your security settings.  Try accessing other databases to see if the problem persists with other databases. If the problem only occurs with the one database you are trying to access, contact a librarian.
