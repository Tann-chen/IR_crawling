 www.concordia.ca/alumni: The towering new Di-Octo sculpture outside the southwest corner the Henry F. Hall Building in Quartier Concordia is unique and mesmerizing. The kinetic artwork was generously donated to the city and university on the occasion of Montreal’s 375th and Canada’s 150th anniversaries by Concordia Chancellor, Montreal businessman and philanthropist Jonathan Wener, BComm 71, and his wife Susan Wener. The eight-metre-high, 725-kilogram sculpture represents a significant contribution to Montreal’s and Concordia’s collection of public art. Di-Octo was created by American artist Anthony Howe.Visit the artist's website at:
