 This oped is part of a series by participants in the Concordia Public Scholars program, a partnership between Concordia University and the Montreal Gazette.  Canadian law provides no guaranteed right to confidentiality for people who participate in research projects. This fact is shocking for researchers in other parts of the world, where researchers and participants can be guaranteed the same legal privilege as a lawyer and client. This legal context makes it difficult for researchers to ensure the protection of our participants, which is vital when engaging in research on sensitive and contentious subjects. If researchers were forced to break confidentiality and violate ethical protections, why would people in vulnerable situations participate, when their private information could later be used against them in court? More broadly, what does this mean for the integrity of research and Canadians’ trust in it? As PhD students undertaking research examining health and social behaviours of people who are part of criminalized populations, we are well aware that research on illicit drug use and sexual behaviours can be very sensitive. It requires building relations of confidence with vulnerable communities. If police and court interference undermine the trust we have built, we could lose access to these communities. This could affect our ability to gather information on complex health and social phenomena, including those deemed illegal, and in turn limit our knowledge and understanding of these issues. And it puts our participants — people who have volunteered to share their life experiences in pursuit of this understanding — in a precarious situation. Late last year, Montreal’s Marie-Ève Maillé had confidential information from her PhD thesis, including the identity of her participants, subpoenaed even after guaranteeing them anonymity. Maillé conducted a survey of rural Quebec residents on the implementation of a wind farm. When residents launched a class action lawsuit, Maillé was asked to testify as an expert. The legal team representing the wind farm subpoenaed Maillé’s raw data, requesting information that would identify her sources. Maillé challenged the subpoena, and a court decided last month in her favour, ruling that protecting the right to confidentiality was in the public interest. This is a big win for Maillé and for the integrity of academic research. But the case reflects a disturbing trend of judicial overreach. Subpoenas for research data appear to be increasing, with one delivered in 2014 to University of Ottawa researchers in a study on sex work, and another last year at Western University in a study on transgender health. The first known case was in 1994. Russell Ogden, a master’s student at Simon Fraser University had his research into assisted suicide among people dying of AIDS subpoenaed in an attempt to identify his participants — people who had helped others die with dignity during end-of-life care. In each of these cases, researchers defended the confidentiality of their participants and won. Despite these wins, future research projects are still vulnerable, leaving Canadian researchers working on complex health and social issues in a context of uncertainty. This does not have to be the case. In the United States, researchers can apply for a Certificate of Confidentiality. This certificate, provided through the National Institutes of Health, protects researchers from the threat of subpoena, fully protecting research participants from the disclosure of identifying information, and providing a true guarantee of confidentiality. The Canadian Tri-Council Research Agencies (CIHR, NSERC & SSHRC) must take action to proactively protect the rights of Canadian research participants, and take the lead in developing a Certificate of Confidentiality for Canadian research. Until then, Canadian researchers are left in a situation that is increasingly unacceptable. Alexander McClelland, a 2017 Concordia Public Scholar, conducts research funded by CIHR to study the criminalization of people with HIV who allegedly did not tell their sex partners they have the virus. Gillian Kolla is conducting CIHR-funded doctoral research at the University of Toronto, where she studies the delivery of health interventions in the communal spaces where people gather to use illicit drugs.  © 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.
