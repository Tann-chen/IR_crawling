                          I love photography and filming short videos, and for me your website provides the most inspiring and creative pool of film-making ideas there is available online. I think the content and concept of the website is brilliant.                       Member since 2014 
                          This is the single best place on the internet to get inspired by beautiful work, thank you for creating this platform.                       Member since 2009 
                          I just wanted to thank the vimeo staff and point out something interesting to staff and community… vimeo has increasingly become the video site of choice for technical directors in the field of film and television. The community of TDs in feature film, games and television is smaller than you'd think, and many of the best and brightest are here on vimeo either posting their work or checking out what the others are doing. Good job vimeo, and thanks community for being a vibrant and active place with videos of constantly superior quality!                       Member since 2008 
                          I really appreciated your timely response and that you actually took the time to read my email, which isn't typical of web tech support services these days. Usually tech support reads half an email and gives a generic solution which doesn't solve the problem at all. If this is the kind of service Vimeo provides than you can count on me being a very happy user.                       About Vimeo Find out what makes us tick.
