 Graduate Andrew Elvish, MFA 97, shares his reasons for making Planned Giving part of his financial strategy.Planned gifts provide the resources that create extraordinary opportunities that can help shape future generations of students. Since its foundation, Concordia has benefited from visionary supporters who have made planned gifts. Their generosity has helped support undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, faculty chairs, research, infrastructure and more.A planned gift can enable you to make a more significant contribution than you thought possible, while allowing you to achieve financial and tax benefits that help fulfill your philanthropic and estate-planning goals. At Concordia, we have a myriad of easy giving options from which you can choose.Planned Giving @ Concordia  Advancement and Alumni Relations
