 Concordia faculty and students are chasing big questions in key Montreal clusters — from aerospace and clean technology to film and financial services; from information and communications technology to life sciences; from health to culture to energy — and beyond.To highlight how Concordians are engaging these and other next-generation challenges, the university has produced a series of videos that display the amplitude of its research and dynamism of its community.In this video, researchers are addressing the question: • How will info, goods and people travel securely in the world of tomorrow?/Comment assurerons-nous la circulation sécuritaire de l'information, des biens et des personnes dans le monde de demain?
