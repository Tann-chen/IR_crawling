We hope you had a great break; sleep, food, family, friends, eggnog…
Anyways, to welcome you back for a new semester we have an event already lined up for you: the Loyola Icebreaker Wine & Cheese! CUPA, along with the Applied Human Sciences Association and the Biology Students Association have organized an event happening at the Hive this Thursday the 5th from 6 – 10. There will be wine. There will be cheese. There will be beautiful people. And it’s all free.
So come by, meet some new faces and hang out with old ones. You can invite people as well. Hope to see you there! Leave a comment Filed under News  Good news guys!!!
We have a date for our hoodie orders! We will be selling the hoodies on November 29th and 30th from 10am – 3pm on both days. We will have a table set up in the SP Atrium (near the security office). We’ll have a big CUPA banner and some demo hoodies (so you can get an idea of the colours and the sizes). Remember, this year you can get a quote on the back of your hoodie for no extra charge. As always, hoodies cost $30 each. More good news: unlike previous years, we will be having two shipments, one per semester. So if you’re going away this winter, you won’t have to wait until next year to pick up your hoodie. If you’re not going away, well, you’ll get to be stylish starting December 🙂
Resources are limited so we can only take 100 orders this semester. 3 orders max per person. First come, first serve, so come quickly! And bring your Concordia IDs. Also, the hoodies are reserved for undergraduate psychology students at Concordia only Leave a comment Filed under News  Hey everyone!
