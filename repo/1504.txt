The discovery search is best described as a keyword search which will expose you to a large variety of library print and subscription materials related to your topic.  Search results include relevant materials found in the library catalogue (CLUES), plus a large proportion of our subscription database articles in full-text, ebooks, images, and more!

Your results will include not only physical items in the library — such as books and print journals — but will also include results for articles and ebooks in our digital collection which can be accessed immediately.
