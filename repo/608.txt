 Each of us, at one time or another, is inspired by someone to reach greater heights. For Tania Shamy — a three-time Concordia graduate, BFA 69, Dip Ed 72, MA 84 — her mother remains a continuous source of inspiration. Shamy's late mother, Yolande Tomiuk, BA 70, had four children yet managed to complete an undergraduate degree as an evening student at Concordia University. After Tomiuk passed away, Shamy contacted Planned Giving to create a bursary for women scholars that would pay homage to her mother.Such planned gifts can help shape the future for a new generation of students. Indeed, planned gifts can support undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, faculty chairs, research, infrastructure and more.A planned gift can enable you to make a more significant contribution than you thought possible, while allowing you to achieve financial and tax benefits that help fulfill your philanthropic and estate-planning goals. At Concordia, we have a myriad of easy giving options from which you can choose.Planned Giving @ Concordia  Advancement and Alumni Relations
