 "Brainwaves" was a Convergence Arts Event held Friday April 7th, 2017 at the Faculty of Fine Arts at Concordia University. The evening began with a private tour of Concordia's Fine Arts facilities led by and offered to Convergence members; Concordia art students from DART 461/4 brought McGill neuroscientists to different studio spaces to experience various artistic activities to generate new perspectives about art making. This video covers this portion of the evening. The second part of the evening consisted of a public conference where Canadian contemporary artist Ingrid Bachmann will speak about her latest body of work, Hybrid Bodies. Her lecture was followed by a student panel entitled Clash/Confusion/Convergence: Thoughts on Collaboration Between the Arts and Sciences in which Concordia Fine Arts students spoke about their personal processes when producing art, and examine their current collaborative work from the perspective of their respective disciplines.This video was made by Concordia Fine Arts Student Lesya Nakoneczny.
